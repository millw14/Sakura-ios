                            Sakura may allow you to connect or create a Solana wallet. You are solely responsible for
                            your wallet, private key, seed phrase, backups, biometric/device security, and every
                            transaction you approve or sign.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Blockchain transactions are generally irreversible. Sakura is not responsible for recovering
                            lost assets, reversing mistaken transfers, or restoring access to compromised wallets.

                            Sakura is not a broker, bank, exchange, investment adviser, or financial adviser.
                            Nothing in Sakura constitutes financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.
